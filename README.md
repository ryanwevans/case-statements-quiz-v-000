# Quiz

?: Which of the following is a case statement?

( )
```ruby
name = "Steven"

if name == "Steven"
  "Hi, #{name}"
else
  puts "Hi, stranger!"
```
(X)
```ruby
name = "Steven"

case name
  when "Steven"
    puts "Hi, #{name}"
  when "Amanda"
    puts "Welcome back, #{name}"
  when "Admin"
    puts "You have all the power!"
  end
```
( )
```ruby
def case
  puts "Am I a case statement?"
end

case
```

?: Of the following two examples, which example uses the case statement the best?

( )
```ruby
name = "Steven"

case name
  when "Steven"
    puts "Hi, #{name}"
  when "Amanda"
    puts "Welcome back, #{name}"
  when "Admin"
    puts "You have all the power!"
  end
```
(X)
```ruby
grade = 95

#--- Updated the ranges to each start at the next integer, because the two-dot range in ruby is inclusive.  Before this change, each range started with the same number that the range before ended with.  This was confusing and may cause students to choose the wrong answer (like I did :) ) ---#
case grade
  when 91..100 then "A"
  when 81..90 then "B"
  when 71..80 then "C"
  when 61..70 then "D"
  when 0..60 then "F"
end
```
( ) Neither are good as case statements

?: Which operator does a case statement use to compare the value to the conditions?

(X) `===`
( ) `==`
( ) `=`
